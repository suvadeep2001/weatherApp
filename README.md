# weather App

This is a weather app using node js and openweathermap api . I have used aios library for fetching the apis. I have followed MVC pattern to make it production ready application. 

## how to start the app ?

```sh
npm install

node src/app.js
```

## You have to install some packages

```sh
npm add express hbs
```
